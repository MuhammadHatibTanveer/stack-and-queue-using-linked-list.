# Stack and Queue Implementation using Linked List

This repository contains an implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked List in Python.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the program using Python (e.g., python stack_queue.py).

## Purpose of the Code

The purpose of this code is to provide a basic implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked List.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Stack and Queue operations is as follows:

* Stack:
	+ Push: O(1)
	+ Pop: O(1)
	+ Peek: O(1)
* Queue:
	+ Enqueue: O(1)
	+ Dequeue: O(1)
	+ Peek: O(1)
